 multiprocessing --- Manage Processes Like Threads
===================================================

.. module:: multiprocessing
    :synopsis: Manage processes like threads.

:Purpose: Provides an API for managing processes.

The ``multiprocessing`` module includes an API for dividing work up
between multiple processes based on the API for :mod:`threading`.  In
some cases ``multiprocessing`` is a drop-in replacement, and can be
used instead of ``threading`` to take advantage of multiple CPU cores
to avoid computational bottlenecks associated with Python's global
interpreter lock.

Due to the similarity, the first few examples here are modified from
the ``threading`` examples.  Features provided by ``multiprocessing``
but not available in ``threading`` are covered later.
