==========================================
 Cooperative Multitasking with Coroutines
==========================================

Coroutines are a language construct designed for concurrent
operation. A coroutine function creates a coroutine object when
called, and the caller can then run the code of the function using the
coroutine's ``send()`` method. A coroutine can pause execution using
the ``await`` keyword with another coroutine. While it is paused, the
coroutine's state is maintained, allowing it to resume where it left
off the next time it is awakened.

Starting a Coroutine
====================

There are a few different ways to have the ``asyncio`` event loop
start a coroutine. The simplest is to use ``run_until_complete()``,
passing the coroutine to it directly.

.. literalinclude:: asyncio_coroutine.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The first step is to obtain a reference to the event loop. The default
loop type can be used, or a specific loop class can be
instantiated. In this example, the default loop is used. The
``run_until_complete()`` method starts the loop with the coroutine
object and stops the loop when the coroutine exits by returning.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'asyncio_coroutine.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 asyncio_coroutine.py
	
	starting coroutine
	entering event loop
	in coroutine
	closing event loop

.. {{{end}}}

Returning Values from Coroutines
================================

The return value of a coroutine is passed back to the code that starts
and waits for it.

.. literalinclude:: asyncio_coroutine_return.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this case, ``run_until_complete()`` also returns the result of
the coroutine it is waiting for.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'asyncio_coroutine_return.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 asyncio_coroutine_return.py
	
	in coroutine
	it returned: 'result'

.. {{{end}}}


Chaining Coroutines
===================

One coroutine can start another coroutine and wait for the
results. This makes it easier to decompose a task into reusable parts.
The following example has two phases that must be executed in order,
but that can run concurrently with other operations.

.. literalinclude:: asyncio_coroutine_chain.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The ``await`` keyword is used instead of adding the new coroutines to
the loop, because control flow is already inside of a coroutine being
managed by the loop so it isn't necessary to tell the loop to manage
the new coroutines.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'asyncio_coroutine_chain.py', line_break_mode='wrap'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 asyncio_coroutine_chain.py
	
	in outer
	waiting for result1
	in phase1
	waiting for result2
	in phase2
	return value: ('result1', 'result2 derived from result1')

.. {{{end}}}

Generators Instead of Coroutines
================================

Coroutine functions are a key component of the design of
``asyncio``. They provide a language construct for stopping the
execution of part of a program, preserving the state of that call, and
re-entering the state at a later time, which are all important
capabilities for a concurrency framework.

Python 3.5 introduced new language features to define such coroutines
natively using ``async def`` and to yield control using ``await``, and
the examples for ``asyncio`` take advantage of the new
feature. Earlier versions of Python 3 can use generator functions
wrapped with the ``asyncio.coroutine()`` decorator and ``yield
from`` to achieve the same effect.

.. literalinclude:: asyncio_generator.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The preceding example reproduces ``asyncio_coroutine_chain.py`` using
generator functions instead of native coroutines.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'asyncio_generator.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 asyncio_generator.py
	
	in outer
	waiting for result1
	in phase1
	waiting for result2
	in phase2
	return value: ('result1', 'result2 derived from result1')

.. {{{end}}}
