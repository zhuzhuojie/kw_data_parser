 asyncio --- Asynchronous I/O, event loop, and concurrency tools
=================================================================

.. module:: asyncio
   :synopsis: Asynchronous I/O, event loop, and concurrency tools

:Purpose: An asynchronous I/O and concurrency framework.

The ``asyncio`` module provides tools for building concurrent
applications using coroutines. While the :mod:`threading` module
implements concurrency through application threads and
:mod:`multiprocessing` implements concurrency using system processes,
``asyncio`` uses a single-threaded, single-process approach in
which parts of an application cooperate to switch tasks explicitly at
optimal times. Most often this context switching occurs when the
program would otherwise block waiting to read or write data, but
``asyncio`` also includes support for scheduling code to run at a
specific future time, to enable one coroutine to wait for another to
complete, for handling system signals, and for recognizing other
events that may be reasons for an application to change what it is
working on.

.. note::

   In Python 3.5, ``asyncio`` is still a *provisional* module. The API
   was stablized in Python 3.6, and most of the changes were
   backported to later patch releases of Python 3.5. As a result, the
   module may work slightly differently under different versions of
   Python 3.5.

..
   - run_until_complete() vs. run_forever()
   - stopping the event loop programmatically -- asyncio_stop.py
   - aiohttp third-party module
   - not sure about
     - pausing transport production in a protocol?
     - using existing sockets?
     - alternate event loops, esp. for Windows
     - waiting for a background task from within a protocol
