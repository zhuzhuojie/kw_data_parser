============================
 Synchronization Primitives
============================

Although ``asyncio`` applications usually run as a single-threaded
process, they are still built as concurrent applications. Each
coroutine or task may execute in an unpredictable order, based on
delays and interrupts from I/O and other external events. To support
safe concurrency, ``asyncio`` includes implementations of some of
the same low-level primitives found in the :mod:`threading` and
:mod:`multiprocessing` modules.

Locks
=====

A ``Lock`` can be used to guard access to a shared resource. Only
the holder of the lock can use the resource. Multiple attempts to
acquire the lock will block so that there is only one holder at a
time.

.. literalinclude:: asyncio_lock.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

A lock's ``acquire()`` method can be invoked directly, using
``await``, and calling the ``release()`` method when done as in
``coro2()`` in this example. They also can be used as asynchronous
context managers with the ``with await`` keywords, as in ``coro1()``.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'asyncio_lock.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 asyncio_lock.py
	
	acquiring the lock before starting coroutines
	lock acquired: True
	waiting for coroutines
	coro2 waiting for the lock
	coro1 waiting for the lock
	callback releasing lock
	coro2 acquired lock
	coro2 released lock
	coro1 acquired lock
	coro1 released lock

.. {{{end}}}

Events
======

An ``asyncio.Event`` is based on ``threading.Event``, and is
used to allow multiple consumers to wait for something to happen
without looking for a specific value to be associated with the
notification.

.. literalinclude:: asyncio_event.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

As with the ``Lock``, both ``coro1()`` and ``coro2()`` wait
for the event to be set. The difference is that both can start as soon
as the event state changes, and they do not need to acquire a unique
hold on the event object.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'asyncio_event.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 asyncio_event.py
	
	event start state: False
	coro2 waiting for event
	coro1 waiting for event
	setting event in callback
	coro2 triggered
	coro1 triggered
	event end state: True

.. {{{end}}}

Conditions
==========

A ``Condition`` works similarly to an ``Event`` except that
rather than notifying all waiting coroutines the number of waiters
awakened is controlled with an argument to ``notify()``.

.. literalinclude:: asyncio_condition.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example starts five consumers of the ``Condition``. Each
uses the ``wait()`` method to wait for a notification that they can
proceed. ``manipulate_condition()`` notifies one consumer, then two
consumers, then all of the remaining consumers.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'asyncio_condition.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 asyncio_condition.py
	
	starting manipulate_condition
	consumer 3 is waiting
	consumer 0 is waiting
	consumer 4 is waiting
	consumer 1 is waiting
	consumer 2 is waiting
	notifying 1 consumers
	consumer 3 triggered
	ending consumer 3
	notifying 2 consumers
	consumer 0 triggered
	ending consumer 0
	consumer 4 triggered
	ending consumer 4
	notifying remaining consumers
	ending manipulate_condition
	consumer 1 triggered
	ending consumer 1
	consumer 2 triggered
	ending consumer 2

.. {{{end}}}

Queues
======

An ``asyncio.Queue`` provides a first-in, first-out data
structure for coroutines like a ``queue.Queue`` does for threads
or a ``multiprocessing.Queue`` does for processes.

.. literalinclude:: asyncio_queue.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Adding items with ``put()`` or removing items with ``get()`` are
both asynchronous operations, since the queue size might be fixed
(blocking an addition) or the queue might be empty (blocking a call to
fetch an item).

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'asyncio_queue.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 asyncio_queue.py
	
	consumer 0: starting
	consumer 0: waiting for item
	consumer 1: starting
	consumer 1: waiting for item
	producer: starting
	producer: added task 0 to the queue
	producer: added task 1 to the queue
	consumer 0: has item 0
	consumer 1: has item 1
	producer: added task 2 to the queue
	producer: added task 3 to the queue
	consumer 0: waiting for item
	consumer 0: has item 2
	producer: added task 4 to the queue
	consumer 1: waiting for item
	consumer 1: has item 3
	producer: added task 5 to the queue
	producer: adding stop signals to the queue
	consumer 0: waiting for item
	consumer 0: has item 4
	consumer 1: waiting for item
	consumer 1: has item 5
	producer: waiting for queue to empty
	consumer 0: waiting for item
	consumer 0: has item None
	consumer 0: ending
	consumer 1: waiting for item
	consumer 1: has item None
	consumer 1: ending
	producer: ending
