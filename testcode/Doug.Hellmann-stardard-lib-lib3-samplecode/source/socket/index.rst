.. module:: socket
    :synopsis: Network communication

:Purpose: Provides access to network communication

The ``socket`` module exposes the low-level C API for communicating
over a network using the BSD socket interface.  It includes the
``socket`` class, for handling the actual data channel, and also
includes functions for network-related tasks such as converting a
server's name to an address and formatting data to be sent across the
network.
