 gettext --- Message Catalogs
==============================

.. module:: gettext
    :synopsis: Message Catalogs

:Purpose: Message catalog API for internationalization.

The ``gettext`` module provides a pure-Python implementation
compatible with the GNU **gettext** library for message translation
and catalog management.  The tools available with the Python source
distribution enable you to extract messages from a set of source
files, build a message catalog containing translations, and use that
message catalog to display an appropriate message for the user at
runtime.

Message catalogs can be used to provide internationalized interfaces
for a program, showing messages in a language appropriate to the user.
They can also be used for other message customizations, including
"skinning" an interface for different wrappers or partners.

.. note::

    Although the standard library documentation says all of the
    necessary tools are included with Python, ``pygettext.py`` failed
    to extract messages wrapped in the ``ngettext`` call, even with
    the appropriate command line options. These examples use
    ``xgettext`` from the GNU **gettext** tool set, instead.

Translation Workflow Overview
=============================

The process for setting up and using translations includes five steps.

1. *Identify and mark up literal strings in the source code that
   contain messages to translate.*

   Start by identifying the messages within the program source that
   need to be translated, and marking the literal strings so the
   extraction program can find them.

2. *Extract the messages.*

   After the translatable strings in the source are identified, use
   ``xgettext`` to extract them and create a ``.pot`` file, or
   *translation template*. The template is a text file with copies of
   all of the strings identified and placeholders for their
   translations.

3. *Translate the messages.*

   Give a copy of the ``.pot`` file to the translator, changing the
   extension to ``.po``. The ``.po`` file is an editable source file
   used as input for the compilation step. The translator should
   update the header text in the file and provide translations for all
   of the strings.

4. *"Compile" the message catalog from the translation.*

   When the translator sends back the completed ``.po`` file, compile
   the text file to the binary catalog format using ``msgfmt``. The
   binary format is used by the runtime catalog lookup code.

5. *Load and activate the appropriate message catalog at runtime.*

   The final step is to add a few lines to the application to
   configure and load the message catalog and install the translation
   function. There are a couple of ways to do that, with associated
   trade-offs.

The rest of this section will examine those steps in a little more
detail, starting with the code modifications needed.

Creating Message Catalogs from Source Code
==========================================

``gettext`` works by looking up literal strings in a database of
translations, and pulling out the appropriate translated string.  The
usual pattern is to bind the appropriate lookup function to the name
"``_``" (a single underscore character) so that the code is not
cluttered with a lot of calls to functions with longer names.

The message extraction program, ``xgettext``, looks for messages
embedded in calls to the catalog lookup functions.  It understands
different source languages and uses an appropriate parser for each.
If the lookup functions are aliased, or extra functions are added,
give ``xgettext`` the names of additional symbols to consider when
extracting messages.

This script has a single message ready to be translated.

.. literalinclude:: gettext_example.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The text ``"This message is in the script."`` is the message to be
substituted from the catalog.  Fallback mode is enabled, so if the
script is run without a message catalog, the in-lined message is
printed.

.. {{{cog
.. [ f.unlink() for f in (cog.inFile.dirname() / 'locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES').glob('*.mo') ]
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'python3 gettext_example.py', interpreter=None))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gettext_example.py
	
	This message is in the script.

.. {{{end}}}

The next step is to extract the message and create the ``.pot`` file,
using ``pygettext.py`` or ``xgettext``.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'xgettext -o example.pot gettext_example.py', interpreter=None))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ xgettext -o example.pot gettext_example.py
	

.. {{{end}}}

The output file produced contains the following content.

.. literalinclude:: example.pot
    :caption:

Message catalogs are installed into directories organized by *domain*
and *language*.  The domain is provided by the application or library,
and is usually a unique value like the application name.  In this
case, the domain in ``gettext_example.py`` is ``example_domain``.  The
language value is provided by the user's environment at runtime,
through one of the environment variables ``LANGUAGE``, ``LC_ALL``,
``LC_MESSAGES``, or ``LANG``, depending on their configuration and
platform.  These examples were all run with the language set to
``en_US``.

Now that the template is ready, the next step is to create the
required directory structure and copy the template in to the right
spot.  The ``locale`` directory inside the PyMOTW source tree will
serve as the root of the message catalog directory for these examples,
but it is typically better to use a directory accessible system-wide
so that all users have access to the message catalogs.  The full path
to the catalog input source is
``$localedir/$language/LC_MESSAGES/$domain.po``, and the actual
catalog has the filename extension ``.mo``.

The catalog is created by copying ``example.pot`` to
``locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/example.po`` and editing it to change
the values in the header and set the alternate messages.  The result
is shown next.

.. literalinclude:: locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/example.po
    :caption:

The catalog is built from the ``.po`` file using ``msgformat``.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'cd locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES; msgfmt -o example.mo example.po', 
..                    interpreter=None))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ cd locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES; msgfmt -o example.mo example.po
	

.. {{{end}}}

The domain in ``gettext_example.py`` is ``example_domain``, but the
file is called ``example.pot``. To have ``gettext`` find the right
translation file, the names need to match.

.. literalinclude:: gettext_example_corrected.py
   :caption:
   :lines: 13-16

Now when the script is run, the message from the catalog is printed
instead of the in-line string.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gettext_example_corrected.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gettext_example_corrected.py
	
	This message is in the en_US catalog.

.. {{{end}}}


Finding Message Catalogs at Runtime
===================================

As described earlier, the *locale directory* containing the message
catalogs is organized based on the language with catalogs named for
the *domain* of the program.  Different operating systems define their
own default value, but ``gettext`` does not know all of these
defaults.  It uses a default locale directory of ``sys.prefix +
'/share/locale'``, but most of the time it is safer to always
explicitly give a ``localedir`` value than to depend on this default
being valid.  The ``find()`` function is responsible for locating an
appropriate message catalog at runtime.

.. literalinclude:: gettext_find.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The language portion of the path is taken from one of several
environment variables that can be used to configure localization
features (``LANGUAGE``, ``LC_ALL``, ``LC_MESSAGES``, and ``LANG``).
The first variable found to be set is used.  Multiple languages can be
selected by separating the values with a colon (``:``).  To see how
that works, use a second message catalog to run a few experiments.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'cd locale/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES; msgfmt -o example.mo example.po', 
..                    interpreter=None, trailing_newlines=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'cd ../../..', 
..                    interpreter=None, trailing_newlines=False, include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gettext_find.py', include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'LANGUAGE=en_CA python3 gettext_find.py', 
..                    interpreter=None, include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'LANGUAGE=en_CA:en_US python3 gettext_find.py', 
..                    interpreter=None, include_prefix=False, break_lines_at=68, 
..                    line_break_mode='wrap'))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'LANGUAGE=en_US:en_CA python3 gettext_find.py', 
..                    interpreter=None, include_prefix=False, break_lines_at=68, 
..                    line_break_mode='wrap'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ cd locale/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES; msgfmt -o example.mo example.po
	$ cd ../../..
	$ python3 gettext_find.py
	
	Catalogs: ['locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/example.mo']

	$ LANGUAGE=en_CA python3 gettext_find.py
	
	Catalogs: ['locale/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES/example.mo']

	$ LANGUAGE=en_CA:en_US python3 gettext_find.py
	
	Catalogs: ['locale/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES/example.mo',
	'locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/example.mo']

	$ LANGUAGE=en_US:en_CA python3 gettext_find.py
	
	Catalogs: ['locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/example.mo',
	'locale/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES/example.mo']

.. {{{end}}}

Although ``find()`` shows the complete list of catalogs, only the
first one in the sequence is actually loaded for message lookups.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gettext_example_corrected.py'))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'LANGUAGE=en_CA python3 gettext_example_corrected.py', 
..                    interpreter=None, include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'LANGUAGE=en_CA:en_US python3 gettext_example_corrected.py', 
..                    interpreter=None, include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'LANGUAGE=en_US:en_CA python3 gettext_example_corrected.py', 
..                    interpreter=None, include_prefix=False))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gettext_example_corrected.py
	
	This message is in the en_US catalog.

	$ LANGUAGE=en_CA python3 gettext_example_corrected.py
	
	This message is in the en_CA catalog.

	$ LANGUAGE=en_CA:en_US python3 gettext_example_corrected.py
	
	This message is in the en_CA catalog.

	$ LANGUAGE=en_US:en_CA python3 gettext_example_corrected.py
	
	This message is in the en_US catalog.

.. {{{end}}}


Plural Values
=============

While simple message substitution will handle most translation needs,
``gettext`` treats pluralization as a special case.  Depending on
the language, the difference between the singular and plural forms of
a message may vary only by the ending of a single word, or the entire
sentence structure may be different.  There may also be different
forms depending on the level of plurality.  To make managing plurals
easier (and, in some cases, possible), there is a separate set of
functions for asking for the plural form of a message.

.. literalinclude:: gettext_plural.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Use ``ngettext()`` to access the plural substitution for a message.
The arguments are the messages to be translated and the item count.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'xgettext -L Python -o plural.pot gettext_plural.py', interpreter=None))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ xgettext -L Python -o plural.pot gettext_plural.py
	

.. {{{end}}}

Since there are alternate forms to be translated, the replacements are
listed in an array.  Using an array allows translations for languages
with multiple plural forms (for example, Polish has different forms
indicating the relative quantity).

.. literalinclude:: plural.pot
    :caption:

In addition to filling in the translation strings, the library needs
to be told about the way plurals are formed so it knows how to index
into the array for any given count value.  The line ``"Plural-Forms:
nplurals=INTEGER; plural=EXPRESSION;\n"`` includes two values to
replace manually.  ``nplurals`` is an integer indicating the size of
the array (the number of translations used) and ``plural`` is a C
language expression for converting the incoming quantity to an index
in the array when looking up the translation.  The literal string
``n`` is replaced with the quantity passed to ``ungettext()``.

For example, English includes two plural forms.  A quantity of ``0``
is treated as plural ("0 bananas").  The ``Plural-Forms`` entry is::

    Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=n != 1;

The singular translation would then go in position 0, and the plural
translation in position 1.

.. literalinclude:: locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/plural.po
    :caption:

Running the test script a few times after the catalog is compiled will
demonstrate how different values of N are converted to indexes for the
translation strings.
    
.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'cd locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/; msgfmt -o plural.mo plural.po',
..                    interpreter=None, trailing_newlines=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'cd ../../..', interpreter=None, include_prefix=False,
..                    trailing_newlines=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gettext_plural.py 0', include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gettext_plural.py 1', include_prefix=False))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gettext_plural.py 2', include_prefix=False))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ cd locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/; msgfmt -o plural.mo plural.po
	$ cd ../../..
	$ python3 gettext_plural.py 0
	
	In en_US, 0 is plural.

	$ python3 gettext_plural.py 1
	
	In en_US, 1 is singular.

	$ python3 gettext_plural.py 2
	
	In en_US, 2 is plural.

.. {{{end}}}

Application vs. Module Localization
===================================

The scope of a translation effort defines how ``gettext`` is
installed and used with a body of code.

Application Localization
------------------------

For application-wide translations, it is acceptable for the
author to install a function like ``ngettext()`` globally using the
``__builtins__`` namespace, because they have control over the
top-level of the application's code.

.. literalinclude:: gettext_app_builtin.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The ``install()`` function binds ``gettext()`` to the name ``_()``
in the ``__builtins__`` namespace.  It also adds ``ngettext()`` and
other functions listed in ``names``.

Module Localization
-------------------

For a library or individual module, modifying ``__builtins__`` is not
a good idea because it may introduce conflicts with an application
global value.  Instead, import or re-bind the names of translation
functions by hand at the top of the module.

.. literalinclude:: gettext_module_global.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Switching Translations
======================

The earlier examples all use a single translation for the duration of
the program.  Some situations, especially web applications, need to
use different message catalogs at different times, without exiting and
resetting the environment.  For those cases, the class-based API
provided in ``gettext`` will be more convenient.  The API calls are
essentially the same as the global calls described in this section,
but the message catalog object is exposed and can be manipulated
directly, so that multiple catalogs can be used.
