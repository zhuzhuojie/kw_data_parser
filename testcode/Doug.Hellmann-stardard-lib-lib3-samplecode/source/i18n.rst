 Internationalization and Localization
=======================================

Python comes with two modules for preparing an application to work
with multiple natural languages and cultural settings.  :mod:`gettext`
is used to create message catalogs in different languages, so that
prompts and error messages can be displayed in a language the user can
understand.  :mod:`locale` changes the way numbers, currency, dates,
and times are formatted to take into account cultural differences such
as how negative values are indicated and what the local currency
symbol is.  Both modules interface with other tools and the operating
environment to make the Python application fit in with all of the
other programs on the system.
