Exception Handling

``sys`` includes features for trapping and working with exceptions.

Unhandled Exceptions
====================

Many applications are structured with a main loop that wraps execution
in a global exception handler to trap errors not handled at a lower
level.  Another way to achieve the same thing is by setting the
``sys.excepthook`` to a function that takes three arguments (the
error type, error value, and traceback) and let it deal with unhandled
errors.

.. literalinclude:: sys_excepthook.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Since there is no ``try:except`` block around the line where
the exception is raised the following call to ``print()`` is not
run, even though the except hook is set.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'sys_excepthook.py', ignore_error=True,
..                       line_break_mode='wrap'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 sys_excepthook.py
	
	Before exception
	Unhandled error: <class 'RuntimeError'> This is the error
	message

.. {{{end}}}

Current Exception
=================

There are times when an explicit exception handler is preferred,
either for code clarity or to avoid conflicts with libraries that try
to install their own ``excepthook``.  In these cases, a common handler
function can be created that does not need to have the exception
object passed to it explicitly by calling ``exc_info()`` to retrieve
the current exception for a thread.

The return value of ``exc_info()`` is a three member tuple
containing the exception class, an exception instance, and a
traceback.  Using ``exc_info()`` is preferred over the old form
(with ``exc_type``, ``exc_value``, and
``exc_traceback``) because it is thread-safe.

.. literalinclude:: sys_exc_info.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example avoids introducing a circular reference between the
traceback object and a local variable in the current frame by ignoring
that part of the return value from ``exc_info()``.  If the traceback
is needed (for example, so it can be logged), explicitly delete the
local variable (using ``del``) to avoid cycles.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'sys_exc_info.py',
..                       line_break_mode='wrap'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 sys_exc_info.py
	
	Handling RuntimeError exception with message "This is the error
	message" in Thread-2
	Handling RuntimeError exception with message "This is the error
	message" in Thread-1

.. {{{end}}}

Previous Interactive Exception
==============================

In the interactive interpreter, there is only one thread of
interaction.  Unhandled exceptions in that thread are saved to three
variables in ``sys`` (``last_type``, ``last_value``, and
``last_traceback``) to make it easy to retrieve them for
debugging.  Using the postmortem debugger in :mod:`pdb` avoids any
need to use the values directly.
