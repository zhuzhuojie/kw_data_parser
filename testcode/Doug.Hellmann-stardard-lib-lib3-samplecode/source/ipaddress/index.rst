 ipaddress --- Internet Addresses
==================================

.. module:: ipaddress
   :synopsis: Classes for working with Internet Protocol (IP)
              addresses.

:Purpose: Classes for working with Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

The ``ipaddress`` module includes classes for working with IPv4 and
IPv6 network addresses. The classes support validation, finding
addresses and hosts on a network, and other common operations.

Addresses
=========

The most basic object represents the network address itself. Pass a
string, integer, or byte sequence to ``ip_address()`` to construct
an address. The return value will be a ``IPv4Address`` or
``IPv6Address`` instance, depending on the type of address being
used.

.. literalinclude:: ipaddress_addresses.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Both classes can provide various representations of the address for
different purposes, as well as answer basic assertions such as whether
the address is reserved for multicast communication or if it is on a
private network.

	      integer: 337611086560236126439725644408160982186
	

.. {{{end}}}

Networks
========

A network is defined by a range of addresses. It is usually
expressed with a base address and a mask indicating which portions of
the address represent the network, and which portions are remaining to
represent addresses on that network. The mask can be expressed
explicitly, or using a prefix length value as in the example below.

.. literalinclude:: ipaddress_networks.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

As with addresses, there are two network classes for IPv4 and IPv6
networks. Each class provides properties or methods for accessing
values associated with the network such as the broadcast address and
the addresses on the network available for hosts to use.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'ipaddress_networks.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 ipaddress_networks.py
	
	IPv4Network('10.9.0.0/24')
	     is private: True
	      broadcast: 10.9.0.255
	     compressed: 10.9.0.0/24
	   with netmask: 10.9.0.0/255.255.255.0
	  with hostmask: 10.9.0.0/0.0.0.255
	  num addresses: 256
	
	IPv6Network('fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::/64')
	     is private: True
	      broadcast: fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
	     compressed: fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::/64
	   with netmask: fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::/ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::
	  with hostmask: fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::/::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
	  num addresses: 18446744073709551616
	

.. {{{end}}}

A network instance is iterable, and yields the addresses on the
network.

.. literalinclude:: ipaddress_network_iterate.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example only prints a few of the addresses, because an IPv6
network can contain far more addresses than fit in the output.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'ipaddress_network_iterate.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 ipaddress_network_iterate.py
	
	IPv4Network('10.9.0.0/24')
	10.9.0.0
	10.9.0.1
	10.9.0.2
	
	IPv6Network('fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::/64')
	fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::
	fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::1
	fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::2
	

.. {{{end}}}

Iterating over the network yields addresses, but not all of them are
valid for hosts. For example, the base address of the network and the
broadcast address are both included. To find the addresses that can be
used by regular hosts on the network, use the ``hosts()`` method,
which produces a generator.

.. literalinclude:: ipaddress_network_iterate_hosts.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Comparing the output of this example with the previous example shows
that the host addresses do not include the first values produced when
iterating over the entire network.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'ipaddress_network_iterate_hosts.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 ipaddress_network_iterate_hosts.py
	
	IPv4Network('10.9.0.0/24')
	10.9.0.1
	10.9.0.2
	10.9.0.3
	
	IPv6Network('fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::/64')
	fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::1
	fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::2
	fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::3
	

.. {{{end}}}

In addition to the iterator protocol, networks support the ``in``
operator to determine if an address is part of a network.

.. literalinclude:: ipaddress_network_membership.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The implementation of ``in`` uses the network mask to test the
address, so it is much more efficient than expanding the full list of
addresses on the network.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'ipaddress_network_membership.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 ipaddress_network_membership.py
	
	10.9.0.6
	is on 10.9.0.0/24
	
	10.7.0.31
	is not on a known network
	
	fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e:b1bc:e121:a8eb:14aa
	is on fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::/64
	
	fe80::3840:c439:b25e:63b0
	is not on a known network
	

.. {{{end}}}

Interfaces
==========

A network interface represents a specific address on a network and can
be represented by a host address and a network prefix or netmask.

.. literalinclude:: ipaddress_interfaces.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The interface object has properties to access the full network and
address separately, as well as several different ways to express the
interface and network mask.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'ipaddress_interfaces.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 ipaddress_interfaces.py
	
	IPv4Interface('10.9.0.6/24')
	network:
	   10.9.0.0/24
	ip:
	   10.9.0.6
	IP with prefixlen:
	   10.9.0.6/24
	netmask:
	   10.9.0.6/255.255.255.0
	hostmask:
	   10.9.0.6/0.0.0.255
	
	IPv6Interface('fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e:b1bc:e121:a8eb:14aa/64')
	network:
	   fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e::/64
	ip:
	   fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e:b1bc:e121:a8eb:14aa
	IP with prefixlen:
	   fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e:b1bc:e121:a8eb:14aa/64
	netmask:
	   fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e:b1bc:e121:a8eb:14aa/ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::
	hostmask:
	   fdfd:87b5:b475:5e3e:b1bc:e121:a8eb:14aa/::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
