 shlex --- Parse Shell-style Syntaxes
======================================

.. module:: shlex
    :synopsis: Lexical analysis of shell-style syntaxes.

:Purpose: Lexical analysis of shell-style syntaxes.

The ``shlex`` module implements a class for parsing simple
shell-like syntaxes. It can be used for writing a domain-specific
language, or for parsing quoted strings (a task that is more complex
than it seems on the surface).

Parsing Quoted Strings
======================

A common problem when working with input text is to identify a
sequence of quoted words as a single entity. Splitting the text on
quotes does not always work as expected, especially if there are
nested levels of quotes. Take the following text as an example.

.. literalinclude:: quotes.txt
   :language: none

A naive approach would be to construct a regular expression to find
the parts of the text outside the quotes to separate them from the
text inside the quotes, or vice versa. That would be unnecessarily
complex and prone to errors resulting from edge cases like apostrophes
or even typos. A better solution is to use a true parser, such as the
one provided by the ``shlex`` module. Here is a simple example that
prints the tokens identified in the input file using the
``shlex`` class.

.. literalinclude:: shlex_example.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

When run on data with embedded quotes, the parser produces the list of
expected tokens.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_example.py quotes.txt'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_example.py quotes.txt
	
	ORIGINAL: 'This string has embedded "double quotes" and\n\'singl
	e quotes\' in it, and even "a \'nested example\'".\n'
	
	TOKENS:
	'This'
	'string'
	'has'
	'embedded'
	'"double quotes"'
	'and'
	"'single quotes'"
	'in'
	'it'
	','
	'and'
	'even'
	'"a \'nested example\'"'
	'.'

.. {{{end}}}

Isolated quotes such as apostrophes are also handled.  Consider this
input file.

.. literalinclude:: apostrophe.txt
   :language: none

The token with the embedded apostrophe is no problem.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_example.py apostrophe.txt'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_example.py apostrophe.txt
	
	ORIGINAL: "This string has an embedded apostrophe, doesn't it?"
	
	TOKENS:
	'This'
	'string'
	'has'
	'an'
	'embedded'
	'apostrophe'
	','
	"doesn't"
	'it'
	'?'

.. {{{end}}}

Making Safe Strings for Shells
==============================

The ``quote()`` function performs the inverse operation, escaping
existing quotes and adding missing quotes for strings to make them
safe to use in shell commands.

.. literalinclude:: shlex_quote.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

It is still usually safer to use a list of arguments when using
``subprocess.Popen``, but in situations where that is not
possible ``quote()`` provides some protection by ensuring that
special characters and white space are quoted properly.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_quote.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_quote.py
	
	ORIGINAL : Embedded'SingleQuote
	QUOTED   : 'Embedded'"'"'SingleQuote'
	
	ORIGINAL : Embedded"DoubleQuote
	QUOTED   : 'Embedded"DoubleQuote'
	
	ORIGINAL : Embedded Space
	QUOTED   : 'Embedded Space'
	
	ORIGINAL : ~SpecialCharacter
	QUOTED   : '~SpecialCharacter'
	
	ORIGINAL : Back\slash
	QUOTED   : 'Back\slash'
	

.. {{{end}}}

Embedded Comments
=================

Since the parser is intended to be used with command languages, it
needs to handle comments. By default, any text following a ``#`` is
considered part of a comment and ignored. Due to the nature of the
parser, only single-character comment prefixes are supported. The set
of comment characters used can be configured through the :attr:`commenters`
property.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_example.py comments.txt'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_example.py comments.txt
	
	ORIGINAL: 'This line is recognized.\n# But this line is ignored.
	\nAnd this line is processed.'
	
	TOKENS:
	'This'
	'line'
	'is'
	'recognized'
	'.'
	'And'
	'this'
	'line'
	'is'
	'processed'
	'.'

.. {{{end}}}

Splitting Strings into Tokens
=============================

To split an existing string into component tokens, the convenience
function ``split()`` is a simple wrapper around the parser.

.. literalinclude:: shlex_split.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The result is a list.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_split.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_split.py
	
	ORIGINAL: 'This text has "quoted parts" inside it.'
	
	TOKENS:
	['This', 'text', 'has', 'quoted parts', 'inside', 'it.']

.. {{{end}}}


Including Other Sources of Tokens
=================================

The ``shlex`` class includes several configuration properties
that control its behavior. The :attr:`source` property enables a
feature for code (or configuration) re-use by allowing one token
stream to include another. This is similar to the Bourne shell
``source`` operator, hence the name.

.. literalinclude:: shlex_source.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The string "``source quotes.txt``" in the original text receives special
handling. Since the :attr:`source` property of the lexer is set to
``"source"``, when the keyword is encountered, the filename appearing
on the next line is automatically included. In order to cause the
filename to appear as a single token, the ``.`` character needs to be
added to the list of characters that are included in words (otherwise
"``quotes.txt``" becomes three tokens, "``quotes``", "``.``",
"``txt``"). This what the output looks like.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_source.py', line_break_mode='wrap'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_source.py
	
	ORIGINAL: 'This text says to source quotes.txt before
	continuing.'
	
	TOKENS:
	'This'
	'text'
	'says'
	'to'
	'This'
	'string'
	'has'
	'embedded'
	'"double quotes"'
	'and'
	"'single quotes'"
	'in'
	'it'
	','
	'and'
	'even'
	'"a \'nested example\'"'
	'.'
	'before'
	'continuing.'

.. {{{end}}}

The source feature uses a method called ``sourcehook()`` to load
the additional input source, so a subclass of ``shlex`` can
provide an alternate implementation that loads data from locations
other than files.

Controlling the Parser
======================

An earlier example demonstrated changing the :attr:`wordchars` value
to control which characters are included in words. It is also possible
to set the :attr:`quotes` character to use additional or alternative
quotes. Each quote must be a single character, so it is not possible
to have different open and close quotes (no parsing on parentheses,
for example).

.. literalinclude:: shlex_table.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this example, each table cell is wrapped in vertical bars.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_table.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_table.py
	
	ORIGINAL: '|Col 1||Col 2||Col 3|'
	
	TOKENS:
	'|Col 1|'
	'|Col 2|'
	'|Col 3|'

.. {{{end}}}

It is also possible to control the whitespace characters used to split
words.

.. literalinclude:: shlex_whitespace.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

If the example in ``shlex_example.py`` is modified to include period
and comma, the results change.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_whitespace.py quotes.txt'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_whitespace.py quotes.txt
	
	ORIGINAL: 'This string has embedded "double quotes" and\n\'singl
	e quotes\' in it, and even "a \'nested example\'".\n'
	
	TOKENS:
	'This'
	'string'
	'has'
	'embedded'
	'"double quotes"'
	'and'
	"'single quotes'"
	'in'
	'it'
	'and'
	'even'
	'"a \'nested example\'"'

.. {{{end}}}


Error Handling
==============

When the parser encounters the end of its input before all quoted
strings are closed, it raises ``ValueError``. When that happens,
it is useful to examine some of the properties maintained by the parser
as it processes the input. For example, :attr:`infile`
refers to the name of the file being processed (which might be
different from the original file, if one file sources another). The
:attr:`lineno` reports the line when the error is discovered. The
:attr:`lineno` is typically the end of the file, which may be far away
from the first quote. The :attr:`token` attribute contains the buffer
of text not already included in a valid token. The
``error_leader()`` method produces a message prefix in a style
similar to Unix compilers, which enables editors such as
``emacs`` to parse the error and take the user directly to the
invalid line.

.. literalinclude:: shlex_errors.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The example produces this output.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_errors.py', ignore_error=True))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_errors.py
	
	ORIGINAL: 'This line is ok.\nThis line has an "unfinished quote.
	\nThis line is ok, too.\n'
	
	TOKENS:
	'This'
	'line'
	'is'
	'ok'
	'.'
	'This'
	'line'
	'has'
	'an'
	ERROR: "None", line 4:  No closing quotation
	following '"unfinished quote.'

.. {{{end}}}


POSIX vs. Non-POSIX Parsing
===========================

The default behavior for the parser is to use a backwards-compatible
style that is not POSIX-compliant. For POSIX behavior, set the ``posix``
argument when constructing the parser.

.. literalinclude:: shlex_posix.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Here are a few examples of the differences in parsing behavior.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'shlex_posix.py', line_break_mode='wrap'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 shlex_posix.py
	
	ORIGINAL : 'Do"Not"Separate'
	non-POSIX: ['Do"Not"Separate']
	POSIX    : ['DoNotSeparate']
	
	ORIGINAL : '"Do"Separate'
	non-POSIX: ['"Do"', 'Separate']
	POSIX    : ['DoSeparate']
	
	ORIGINAL : 'Escaped \\e Character not in quotes'
	non-POSIX: ['Escaped', '\\', 'e', 'Character', 'not', 'in',
	'quotes']
	POSIX    : ['Escaped', 'e', 'Character', 'not', 'in', 'quotes']
	
	ORIGINAL : 'Escaped "\\e" Character in double quotes'
	non-POSIX: ['Escaped', '"\\e"', 'Character', 'in', 'double',
	'quotes']
	POSIX    : ['Escaped', '\\e', 'Character', 'in', 'double',
	'quotes']
	
	ORIGINAL : "Escaped '\\e' Character in single quotes"
	non-POSIX: ['Escaped', "'\\e'", 'Character', 'in', 'single',
	'quotes']
	POSIX    : ['Escaped', '\\e', 'Character', 'in', 'single',
	'quotes']
	
	ORIGINAL : 'Escaped \'\\\'\' \\"\\\'\\" single quote'
	non-POSIX: error(No closing quotation)
	POSIX    : ['Escaped', '\\ \\"\\"', 'single', 'quote']
	
	ORIGINAL : 'Escaped "\\"" \\\'\\"\\\' double quote'
	non-POSIX: error(No closing quotation)
	POSIX    : ['Escaped', '"', '\'"\'', 'double', 'quote']
	
	ORIGINAL : '"\'Strip extra layer of quotes\'"'
	non-POSIX: ['"\'Strip extra layer of quotes\'"']
	POSIX    : ["'Strip extra layer of quotes'"]
