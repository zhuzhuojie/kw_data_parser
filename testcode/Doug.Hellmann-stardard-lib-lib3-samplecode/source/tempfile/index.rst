 tempfile --- Temporary File System Objects
============================================

.. module:: tempfile
    :synopsis: Temporary file system objects

:Purpose: Create temporary file system objects.

Creating temporary files with unique names securely, so they cannot be
guessed by someone wanting to break the application or steal the data,
is challenging. The ``tempfile`` module provides several functions
for creating temporary file system resources securely.
``TemporaryFile()`` opens and returns an unnamed file,
``NamedTemporaryFile()`` opens and returns a named file,
``SpooledTemporaryFile`` holds its content in memory before
writing to disk, and ``TemporaryDirectory`` is a context manager
that removes the directory when the context is closed.

Temporary Files
===============

Applications that need temporary files to store data, without needing
to share that file with other programs, should use the
``TemporaryFile()`` function to create the files. The function
creates a file, and on platforms where it is possible, unlinks it
immediately. This makes it impossible for another program to find or
open the file, since there is no reference to it in the file system
table. The file created by ``TemporaryFile()`` is removed
automatically when it is closed, whether by calling ``close()`` or
by using the context manager API and ``with`` statement.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_TemporaryFile.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example illustrates the difference in creating a temporary file
using a common pattern for making up a name, versus using the
``TemporaryFile()`` function. The file returned by
``TemporaryFile()`` has no name.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_TemporaryFile.py', break_lines_at=58))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_TemporaryFile.py
	
	Building a filename with PID:
	temp:
	  <_io.BufferedRandom name='/tmp/guess_my_name.12151.txt'>
	temp.name:
	  '/tmp/guess_my_name.12151.txt'
	
	TemporaryFile:
	temp:
	  <_io.BufferedRandom name=4>
	temp.name:
	  4

.. {{{end}}}

By default, the file handle is created with mode ``'w+b'`` so it
behaves consistently on all platforms and the caller can write to it
and read from it.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_TemporaryFile_binary.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

After writing, the file handle must be "rewound" using ``seek()``
in order to read the data back from it.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_TemporaryFile_binary.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_TemporaryFile_binary.py
	
	b'Some data'

.. {{{end}}}

To open the file in text mode, set ``mode`` to ``'w+t'`` when the file
is created.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_TemporaryFile_text.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The file handle treats the data as text.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_TemporaryFile_text.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_TemporaryFile_text.py
	
	first
	second

.. {{{end}}}

Named Files
===========

There are situations where having a named temporary file is
important. For applications spanning multiple processes, or even
hosts, naming the file is the simplest way to pass it between parts of
the application. The ``NamedTemporaryFile()`` function creates a
file without unlinking it, so it retains its name (accessed with the
:attr:`name` attribute).

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_NamedTemporaryFile.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The file is removed after the handle is closed.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_NamedTemporaryFile.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_NamedTemporaryFile.py
	
	temp:
	  <tempfile._TemporaryFileWrapper object at 0x1011b2d30>
	temp.name:
	  '/var/folders/5q/8gk0wq888xlggz008k8dr7180000hg/T/tmps4qh5zde'
	Exists after close: False

.. {{{end}}}

Spooled Files
=============

For temporary files containing relatively small amounts of data, it is
likely to be more efficient to use a ``SpooledTemporaryFile`` because
it holds the file contents in memory using a ``io.BytesIO`` or
``io.StringIO`` buffer until they reach a threshold size. When the
amount of data passes the threshold, it is "rolled over" and written
to disk, and then the buffer is replaced with a normal
``TemporaryFile()``.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_SpooledTemporaryFile.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example uses private attributes of the ``SpooledTemporaryFile``
to determine when the rollover to disk has happened. It is not
normally necessary to check this status except when tuning the buffer
size.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_SpooledTemporaryFile.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_SpooledTemporaryFile.py
	
	temp: <tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile object at 0x1007b2c88>
	False <_io.StringIO object at 0x1007a3d38>
	False <_io.StringIO object at 0x1007a3d38>
	True <_io.TextIOWrapper name=4 mode='w+t' encoding='utf-8'>

.. {{{end}}}

To explicitly cause the buffer to be written to disk, call the
``rollover()`` or ``fileno()`` methods.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_SpooledTemporaryFile_explicit.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this example, because the buffer size is so much larger than the
amount of data, no file would be created on disk except that
``rollover()`` was called.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_SpooledTemporaryFile_explicit.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_SpooledTemporaryFile_explicit.py
	
	temp: <tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile object at 0x1007b2c88>
	False <_io.StringIO object at 0x1007a3d38>
	False <_io.StringIO object at 0x1007a3d38>
	False <_io.StringIO object at 0x1007a3d38>
	rolling over
	True <_io.TextIOWrapper name=4 mode='w+t' encoding='utf-8'>

.. {{{end}}}

Temporary Directories
=====================

When several temporary files are needed, it may be more convenient to
create a single temporary directory with ``TemporaryDirectory``
and open all of the files in that directory.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_TemporaryDirectory.py
   :caption:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The context manager produces the name of the directory, which can then
be used within the context block to build other file names.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_TemporaryDirectory.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_TemporaryDirectory.py
	
	/var/folders/5q/8gk0wq888xlggz008k8dr7180000hg/T/tmp_urhiioj
	Directory exists after? False
	Contents after: []

.. {{{end}}}

Predicting Names
================

While less secure than strictly anonymous temporary files, including a
predictable portion in the name makes it possible to find the file and
examine it for debugging purposes. All of the functions described so
far take three arguments to control the filenames to some
degree. Names are generated using the formula:

.. code-block:: none

    dir + prefix + random + suffix

All of the values except ``random`` can be passed as arguments to the
functions for creating temporary files or directories.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_NamedTemporaryFile_args.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The ``prefix`` and ``suffix`` arguments are combined with a random string
of characters to build the filename, and the ``dir`` argument is taken
as-is and used as the location of the new file.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_NamedTemporaryFile_args.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_NamedTemporaryFile_args.py
	
	temp:
	   <tempfile._TemporaryFileWrapper object at 0x1018b2d68>
	temp.name:
	   /tmp/prefix_q6wd5czl_suffix

.. {{{end}}}

Temporary File Location
=======================

If an explicit destination is not given using the ``dir`` argument, the
path used for the temporary files will vary based on the current
platform and settings. The ``tempfile`` module includes two
functions for querying the settings being used at runtime.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_settings.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

``gettempdir()`` returns the default directory that will hold all
of the temporary files and ``gettempprefix()`` returns the string
prefix for new file and directory names.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_settings.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_settings.py
	
	gettempdir(): /var/folders/5q/8gk0wq888xlggz008k8dr7180000hg/T
	gettempprefix(): tmp

.. {{{end}}}

The value returned by ``gettempdir()`` is set based on a
straightforward algorithm of looking through a list of locations for
the first place the current process can create a file.  The search
list is:

1. The environment variable ``TMPDIR``
2. The environment variable ``TEMP``
3. The environment variable ``TMP``
4. A fallback, based on the platform.  (Windows uses the first
   available of ``C:\temp``, ``C:\tmp``, ``\temp``, or ``\tmp``.
   Other platforms use ``/tmp``, ``/var/tmp``, or ``/usr/tmp``.)
5. If no other directory can be found, the current working directory
   is used.

.. literalinclude:: tempfile_tempdir.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Programs that need to use a global location for all temporary files
without using any of these environment variables should set
``tempfile.tempdir`` directly by assigning a value to the
variable.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'tempfile_tempdir.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 tempfile_tempdir.py
	
	gettempdir(): /I/changed/this/path

.. {{{end}}}
