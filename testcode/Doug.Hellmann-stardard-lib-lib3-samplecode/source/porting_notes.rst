New Modules
===========

Python 3 includes a number of new modules, providing features not
present in Python 2.

:mod:`asyncio`
  Asynchronous I/O, event loop, and other concurrency tools

:mod:`concurrent.futures`
  Managing Pools of Concurrent Tasks

:mod:`ensurepip`
  Install the Python Package Installer, pip

:mod:`enum`
  Defines enumeration type

:mod:`ipaddress`
  Classes for working with Internet Protocol (IP) addresses

:mod:`pathlib`
  An object-oriented API for working with filesystem paths

:mod:`selectors`
  I/O Multiplexing Abstractions

:mod:`statistics`
  Statistical Calculations

:mod:`venv`
  Create isolated installation and execution contexts


Renamed Modules
===============

Many standard library modules were renamed between Python 2 and 3 as
part of PEP 3108. All of the new module names consistently use lowercase, and some have been moved into packages to better organize
related modules. Often, code using these modules can be updated to
work with Python 3 just by fixing the import statements. A complete
list of the renames can be found in the dictionary
``lib2to3.fixes.fix_imports.MAPPING`` (the keys are the Python 2 name
and the values are the Python 3 name) and in :table:`Renamed Modules`.

   * The six_ package is useful for writing code that runs under both
     Python 2 and 3. In particular, the ``six.moves`` module allows
     your code to import renamed modules using a single import
     statement, automatically redirecting the import to the correct
     version of the name depending on the version of Python.

The :mod:`popen2` module has been removed. See :mod:`subprocess`
instead.

posixfile
---------

.. index::
   pair: porting; io

The :mod:`posixfile` module has been removed. See :mod:`io` instead.

sets
----

The :mod:`sets` module was deprecated in Python 2.6 and removed in
Python 3.0. Use the built-in types ``set`` and
``orderedset`` instead.

sha
---

.. index::
   pair: porting; hashlib

The implementation of the SHA-1 message digest algorithm has moved
to :mod:`hashlib`.

sre
---

.. index::
   pair: porting; re

The :mod:`sre` module was deprecated in Python 2.5 and removed in
Python 3.0. Use :mod:`re` instead.

statvfs
-------

.. index::

in Python 3.0. See ``os.statvfs()`` in the :mod:`os` module
instead.


thread
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; threading

The :mod:`thread` module has been removed.  Use the higher-level API
in :mod:`threading` instead.

user
----

.. index::
   pair: porting; site

Python 3.0. See user-customization features provided by the
:mod:`site` module instead.

Deprecated Modules
==================

.. index::
   single: porting; deprecated modules

These modules are still present in the standard library, but are
deprecated and should not be used in new Python 3 programs.

asyncore and asynchat
---------------------

.. index::
   pair: porting; asyncore
   pair: porting; asynchat

Access the implementation of the import statement. See
:mod:`importlib` instead.

optparse
--------

.. index::
   pair: porting; optparse
   pair: porting; argparse

Command-line option parsing library. The API for :mod:`argparse` is
similar to the one provided by :mod:`optparse`, and in many cases
:mod:`argparse` can be used as a straightforward replacement by
updating the names of the classes and methods used.


Summary of Changes to Modules
=============================

.. index::
   single: porting; changed modules

.. _porting-abc:

abc
---

.. index::
   pair: porting; abc

The ``abstractproperty()``, ``abstractclassmethod()``, and
``abstractstaticmethod()`` decorators are deprecated. Combining
``abstractmethod()`` with the ``property()``, ``classmethod()``,
and ``staticmethod()`` decorators works as expected
(:pyissue:`11610`).

.. _porting-anydbm:

anydbm
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; anydbm
   pair: porting; dbm

The ``anydbm`` module has been renamed :mod:`dbm` in Python 3.

.. _porting-argparse:

argparse
--------

.. index::
   pair: porting; argparse

The ``version`` argument to ``ArgumentParser`` has been removed
in favor of a special ``action`` type (:pyissue:`13248`).

The old form passed ``version`` as an argument.

::

  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(version='1.0')

The new form requires adding an explicit argument definition.

::

  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
  parser.add_argument('--version', action='version',
                      version='%(prog)s 1.0')

The option name and version format string can be modified to suit the
needs of the application.

In Python 3.4, the version action was changed to print the version
string to stdout instead of stderr (:pyissue:`18920`).

.. _porting-array:

array
-----

.. index::
   pair: porting; array

The ``'c'`` type used for character bytes in early version of Python 2
has been removed. Use ``'b'`` or ``'B'`` for bytes instead.

The ``'u'`` type for characters from Unicode strings has been
deprecated and will be removed in Python 4.0.

The methods ``tostring()`` and ``fromstring()`` have been renamed
``tobytes()`` and ``frombytes()`` to remove ambiguity
(:pyissue:`8990`).

.. _porting-atexit:

atexit
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; atexit

When :mod:`atexit` was updated to include a C implementation
(:pyissue:`1680961`), a regression was introduced in the error
handling logic that caused only the summary of the exception to be
shown, without the traceback. This regression was fixed in Python 3.3
(:pyissue:`18776`).

.. _porting-base64:

base64
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; base64

The ``encodestring()`` and ``decodestring()`` have been renamed
``encodebytes()`` and ``decodebytes()`` respectively. The old
names still work as aliases, but are deprecated (:pyissue:`3613`).

Two new encodings using 85-character alphabets have been
added. ``b85encode()`` implements an encoding used in Mercurial and
git, while ``a85encode()`` implements the Ascii85 format used by PDF
files (:pyissue:`17618`).

.. _porting-bz2:

bz2
---

.. index::
   pair: porting; bz2

``BZ2File`` instances now support the context manager protocol,
and do not need to be wrapped with ``contextlib.closing()``.

.. _porting-collections:

collections
-----------

.. index::
   pair: porting; collections

The abstract base classes formerly defined in :mod:`collections` moved
to :mod:`collections.abc`, with backwards-compatibility imports in
:mod:`collections`, for now (:pyissue:`11085`).

.. _porting-comands:

comands
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; comands
   pair: porting; subprocess

The functions ``getoutput()`` and ``getstatusoutput()`` have been
moved to :mod:`subprocess` and :mod:`commands` has been deleted.

.. _porting-configparser:

configparser
------------

.. index::
   pair: porting; configparser

The old ``ConfigParser`` module has been renamed to
:mod:`configparser`.

The old ``ConfigParser`` class was removed in favor of
``SafeConfigParser`` which has in turn been renamed to
``ConfigParser``. The deprecated interpolation behavior is
available via ``LegacyInterpolation``.

The ``read()`` method now supports an ``encoding`` argument, so it
is no longer necessary to use :mod:`codecs` to read configuration
files with Unicode values in them.

Using the old ``RawConfigParser`` is discouraged. New projects
should use ``ConfigParser(interpolation=None)`` instead to achieve the
same behavior.

.. _porting-contextlib:

contextlib
----------

.. index::
   pair: porting; contextlib

``contextlib.nested()`` has been removed. Pass multiple context
managers to the same ``with`` statement instead.

.. _porting-csv:

csv
---

.. index::
   pair: porting; csv

Instead of using the ``next()`` method of a reader directly, use the
built-in ``next()`` function to invoke the iterator properly.

.. _porting-datetime:

datetime
--------

.. index::
   pair: porting; datetime

Starting with Python 3.3, equality comparisons between naive and
timezone-aware ``datetime`` instances return ``False`` instead of
raising ``TypeError`` (:pyissue:`15006`).

Prior to Python 3.5, a ``datetime.time`` object representing
midnight evaluated to ``False`` when converted to a Boolean. This
behavior has been removed in Python 3.5 (:pyissue:`13936`).

.. _porting-decimal:

decimal
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; decimal

Python 3.3 incorporated a C implementation of :mod:`decimal` based on
``libmpdec``. This change improved performance, but also includes some
API changes and behavior differences from the pure-Python
implementation. See `the Python 3.3 release notes
<https://docs.python.org/3.3/whatsnew/3.3.html#decimal>`__ for
details.

.. _porting-fractions:

fractions
---------

.. index::
   pair: porting; fractions

The ``from_float()`` and ``from_decimal()`` class methods are no
longer needed. Floating point and ``Decimal`` values can be
passed directly to the ``Fraction`` constructor.

.. _porting-gc:

gc
--

.. index::
   pair: porting; gc

The flags ``DEBUG_OBJECT`` and ``DEBUG_INSTANCE`` have been
removed. They are no longer needed to differentiate between new and
old-style classes.


.. _porting-gettext:

gettext
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; gettext

All of the translation functions in :mod:`gettext` assume Unicode
input and output, and the Unicode variants such as ``ugettext()``
have been removed.


.. _porting-glob:

glob
----

.. index::
   pair: porting; glob

The new function ``escape()`` implements a work-around for searching
for files with meta-characters in the name (:pyissue:`8402`).

.. _porting-http.cookies:

http.cookies
------------

.. index::
   pair: porting; http.cookies

In addition to escaping quotes, SimpleCookie also encodes commas and
semi-colons in values to better reflect behavior in real browsers
(:pyissue:`9824`).


.. _porting-imaplib:

imaplib
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; imaplib

Under Python 3, :mod:`imaplib` returns byte-strings encoded as
UTF-8. There is support for accepting Unicode strings and encoding
them automatically as outgoing commands are sent or as the username
and password for logging in to the server.

.. _porting-importlib:

importlib
---------

The ``find_loader()`` function is deprecated. Use
``importlib.util.find_spec()`` instead.

.. _porting-inspect:

inspect
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; inspect

The functions ``getargspec()``, ``getfullargspec()``,
``getargvalues()``, ``getcallargs()``, ``getargvalues()``,
``formatargspec()``, and ``formatargvalues()`` have been
deprecated in favor of ``signature()`` (:pyissue:`20438`).

.. _porting-itertools:

itertools
---------

.. index::
   pair: porting; itertools

The functions ``imap()``, ``izip()``, and ``ifilter()`` have
been replaced with versions of the built-in functions that return
iterables instead of ``list`` objects (``map()``, ``zip()``,
and ``filter:()`` respectively).

The function ``ifilterfalse()`` has been renamed
``filterfalse()``.

.. _porting-json:

json
----

.. index::
   pair: porting; json

The :mod:`json` API was updated to only support ``str`` and not
with ``bytes`` because the JSON specification is defined using
Unicode.

.. _porting-locale:

locale
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; locale

The normalized version of the name of the UTF-8 encoding has changed
from "UTF8" to "UTF-8" because Mac OS X and OpenBSD do not support the
use of "UTF8" (:pyissue:`10154` and :pyissue:`10090`).

.. _porting-logging:

logging
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; logging

The :mod:`logging` module now includes a ``lastResort`` logger that is
used if no other logging configuration is performed by an
application. This eliminates the need to configure logging in an
application solely to avoid having a user see error messages in case a
library imported by an application uses logging but the application
itself does not.

.. _porting-mailbox:

mailbox
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; mailbox

mailbox reads and writes mailbox files in binary mode, relying on the
email package to parse messages.  StringIO and text file input is
deprecated (:pyissue:`9124`).

.. _porting-mmap:

mmap
----

.. index::
   pair: porting; mmap

Values returned from read APIs are byte strings, and need to be
decoded before being treated as text.

.. _porting-operator:

operator
--------

.. index::
   pair: porting; operator

The ``div()`` function has been removed. Use either ``floordiv()``
or ``truediv()``, depending on the desired semantics.

The ``repeat()`` function is removed. Use ``mul()`` instead.

The functions ``getslice()``, ``setslice()``, and ``delslice()``
are removed. Use ``getitem()``, ``setitem()``, and ``delitem()``
with slice indexes instead.

The function ``isCallable()`` has been removed. Use the abstract
base class ``collections.Callable`` instead.

.. code-block:: python

   isinstance(obj, collections.Callable)

The type checking functions ``isMappingType()``,
``isSequenceType()``, and ``isNumberType()`` have been
removed. Use the relevant abstract base classes from
:mod:`collections` or :mod:`numbers` instead.

.. code-block:: python

   isinstance(obj, collections.Mapping)
   isinstance(obj, collections.Sequence)
   isinstance(obj, numbers.Number)

The ``sequenceIncludes()`` function has been removed. Use
``contains()`` instead.

.. _porting-os:

os
--

.. index::
   pair: porting; os

The functions ``popen2()``, ``popen3()``, and ``popen4()`` have
been removed.  ``popen()`` is still present but deprecated and emits
warnings if used.  Code using these functions should be rewritten to
use :mod:`subprocess` instead to be more portable across operating
systems.

The functions ``os.tmpnam()``, ``os.tempnam()`` and
``os.tmpfile()`` have been removed. Use the :mod:`tempfile` module
instead.

The function ``os.stat_float_times()`` is deprecated
(:pyissue:`14711`).

``os.unsetenv()`` no longer ignores errors (:pyissue:`13415`).

.. _porting-os.path:

os.path
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; os.path

``os.path.walk()`` has been removed. Use ``os.walk()`` instead.


.. _porting-pdb:

pdb
---

.. index::
   pair: porting; pdb

The ``print`` command alias has been removed so that it does not
shadow the ``print()`` function (:pyissue:`18764`). The ``p`` shortcut
is retained.

.. _porting-pickle:

pickle
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; pickle

The C implementation of the pickle module from Python 2 has been moved
to a new module that is automatically used to replace the Python
implementation when possible. The old import idiom of looking for
``cPickle`` before ``pickle`` is no longer needed.

::

    try:
       import cPickle as pickle
    except:
       import pickle

With the automatic import of the C implementation, it is only
necessary to import the ``pickle`` module directly.

::

    import pickle

Interoperability between Python 2.x and 3.x has been improved for
pickled data using the level 2 protocol or lower to resolve an issue
introduced when a large number of standard library modules were
renamed during the transition to Python 3. Because pickled data
includes references to class and type names, and those names changed,
it was difficult to exchange pickled data between Python 2 and 3
programs. Now for data pickled using protocol level 2 or older, the
old names of the classes are automatically used when writing to and
reading from a pickle stream.

This behavior is available by default, and can be turned off using the
``fix_imports`` option. This change improves the situation, but does
not eliminate incompatibilities entirely. In particular, it is
possible that data pickled under Python 3.1 can't be read under Python
3.0. To ensure maximum portability between Python 3 applications, use
protocol level 3, which does not include this compatibility feature.

The default protocol version has changed from ``0``, the
human-readable version, to ``3``, the binary format with the best
interoperability when shared between Python 3 applications.

Byte string data written to a pickle by a Python 2.x application is
decoded when it is read back to create a Unicode string object. The
encoding for the transformation defaults to ASCII, and can be changed
by passing values to the ``Unpickler``.

.. _porting-pipes:

pipes
-----

.. index::
   pair: porting; pipes

``pipes.quote()`` has moved to :mod:`shlex` (:pyissue:`9723`).

.. _porting-platform:

platform
--------

.. index::
   pair: porting; platform

``platform.popen()`` has been deprecated. Use ``subprocess.popen()``
instead (:pyissue:`11377`).

``platform.uname()`` now returns a ``namedtuple``.

Because Linux distributions do not have a consistent way to describe
themselves, the functions for getting the descriptions
(``platform.dist()`` and ``platform.linux_distribution()``) are
deprecated and scheduled to be removed in Python 3.7
(:pyissue:`1322`).

.. _porting-random:

random
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; random

The function ``jumpahead()`` was removed in Python 3.0.


.. _porting-re:

re
--

.. index::
   pair: porting; re

The ``UNICODE`` flag represents the default behavior. To restore
the ASCII-specific behavior from Python 2, use the ``ASCII``
flag.


.. _porting-shelve:

shelve
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; shelve

The default output format for :mod:`shelve` may create a file with a
``.db`` extension added to the name given to ``shelve.open()``.

.. _porting-signal:

signal
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; signal

:pep:`475` means that system calls interrupted and returning with
``EINTR`` are retried. This changes the behavior of signal handlers
and other system calls, since now after the signal handler returns the
interrupted call will be retried, unless the signal handler raises an
exception. Refer to the PEP documentation for complete details.

.. _porting-socket:

socket
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; socket

Under Python 2 typically ``str`` objects could be sent directly
over a socket. Because ``str`` replaces ``unicode``, in
Python 3 the values must be encoded before being sent. The examples in
the :mod:`socket` section use byte strings, which are already encoded.

.. _porting-socketserver:

socketserver
------------

.. index::
   pair: porting; socketserver

The :mod:`socketserver` module was named ``SocketServer`` under
Python 2.


.. _porting-string:

string
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; string

All functions from the :mod:`string` module that are also methods of
``str`` objects have been removed.

The constants ``letters``, ``lowercase``, and
``uppercase`` have been removed. The new constants with similar
names are limited to the ASCII character set.

The ``maketrans()`` function has been replaced by methods on
``str``, ``bytes``, and ``bytearray`` to clarify which
input types are supported by each translation table.


.. _porting-struct:

struct
------

.. index::
   pair: porting; struct

``struct.pack()`` now only supports byte strings when using the
``s`` string pack code, and no longer implicitly encodes string
objects to UTF-8 (:pyissue:`10783`).

.. _porting-subprocess:

subprocess
----------

.. index::
   pair: porting; subprocess

The default value for the ``close_fds`` argument to
``subprocess.Popen`` has changed from always being ``False``. It
always defaults to ``True`` under Unix. It defaults to ``True`` under
Windows if the standard I/O stream arguments are set to ``None``,
otherwise it defaults to ``False``.

.. _porting-sys:

sys
---

.. index::
   pair: porting; sys

.. Patch #1680961

The variable ``sys.exitfunc`` is no longer checked for a clean-up
action to be run when a program exits. Use :mod:`atexit` instead.

The variable ``sys.subversion`` is no longer defined.

Flags ``sys.flags.py3k_warning``,
``sys.flags.division_warning``, ``sys.flags.division_new``,
``sys.flags.tabcheck``, and ``sys.flags.unicode`` are no
longer defined.

The variable ``sys.maxint`` is no longer defined, use
``sys.maxsize`` instead. See :pep:`237` (Unifying Long Integers
and Integers).

The global exception tracking variables ``sys.exc_type``,
``sys.exc_value``, and ``sys.exc_traceback`` have been
removed. The function ``sys.exc_clear()`` has also been removed.

The variable ``sys.version_info`` is now a :py``namedtuple``
instance with attributes ``major``, ``minor``, ``micro``,
``releaselevel``, and ``serial`` (:pyissue:`4285`).

.. http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2009-October/093321.html

The check interval feature, controlling the number of opcodes to
execute before allowing a thread context switch has been replaced with
an absolute time value instead, managed with
``sys.setswitchinterval()``. The old functions for managing the
check interval, ``sys.getcheckinterval()`` and
``sys.setcheckinterval()``, are deprecated.

.. https://docs.python.org/3.3/whatsnew/3.3.html#visible-changes

The ``sys.meta_path`` and ``sys.path_hooks`` variables now
expose all of the path finders and entry hooks for importing
modules. In earlier versions, only finders and hooks explicitly added
to the path were exposed, and the C import used values in its
implementation that could not be modified from the outside.

For Linux systems, ``sys.platform`` no longer includes the version
number. The value is now just ``linux`` and not ``linux2`` or
``linux3``.

.. _porting-threading:

threading
---------

.. index::
   pair: porting; threading
   pair: porting; thread

The ``thread`` module is deprecated in favor of the API in
:mod:`threading`.

The debugging features of :mod:`threading`, including the "verbose"
argument has been removed from the APIs (:pyissue:`13550`).

Older implementations of :mod:`threading` used factory functions for
some of the classes because they were implemented in C as extension
types and could not be subclassed. That limitation of the language has
been removed, and so many of the old factory functions have been
converted to standard classes, which allow subclassing
(:pyissue:`10968`).

The public symbols exported from :mod:`threading` have been renamed to
be :pep:`8` compliant. The old names are retained for backwards
compatibility, but they will be removed in a future release.

.. _porting-time:

time
----

.. index::
   pair: porting; time

``time.asctime()`` and ``time.ctime()`` have been reimplemented to
not use the system functions of the same time to allow larger years to
be used. ``time.ctime()`` now supports years from 1900 through
``maxint``, although for values higher than ``9999`` the output
string is longer than the standard 24 characters to allow for the
extra year digits (:pyissue:`8013`).

.. _porting-unittest:

unittest
--------

.. index::
   pair: porting; unittest

The ``TestCase`` methods starting with "fail" (``failIf()``,
``failUnless()``, etc.) have been deprecated. Use the alternate form
of the assert methods instead.

Several older method aliases have been deprecated and replaced with
preferred names. Using the deprecated names produces a warning
(:pyissue:`9424`). See :table:`Deprecated unittest.TestCase Methods`
for a mapping between the old and new names.

.. list-table:: Deprecated unittest.TestCase Methods
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Deprecated Name
     - Preferred Name
   * - ``assert_()``
     - ``assertTrue()``
   * - ``assertEquals()``
     - ``assertEqual()``
   * - ``assertNotEquals()``
     - ``assertNotEqual()``
   * - ``assertAlmostEquals()``
     - ``assertAlmostEqual()``
   * - ``assertNotAlmostEquals()``
     - ``assertNotAlmostEqual()``

UserDict, UserList, and UserString
----------------------------------

.. index::
   pair: porting; UserDict
   pair: porting; UserList
   pair: porting; UserString

The UserDict, UserList, and UserString classes have been moved out of
their own modules into the :mod:`collections` module. ``dict``,
``list``, and ``str`` can be subclassed directly, but the
classes in :mod:`collections` may make implementing the subclass
simpler because the content of the container is available directly
through an instance attribute. The abstract classes in
:mod:`collections.abc` are also useful for creating custom containers
that follow the APIs of the built-in types.

.. _porting-uuid:

uuid
----

.. index::
   pair: porting; uuid

``uuid.getnode()`` now uses the ``PATH`` environment variable to
find programs that can report the MAC address of the host under Unix
(:pyissue:`19855`). It falls back to looking in ``/sbin`` and
``/usr/sbin`` if no program is found on the search path. This search
behavior may give different results than with earlier versions of
Python if alternate versions of programs like ``netstat``,
``ifconfig``, ``ip``, and ``arp`` are present and produce different
output.

.. _porting-whichdb:

whichdb
-------

.. index::
   pair: porting; whichdb

The functionality of ``whichdb`` has moved to the :mod:`dbm` module.

.. _porting-xml.etree.ElementTree:

xml.etree.ElementTree
---------------------

.. index::
   pair: porting; xml.etree.ElementTree

``XMLTreeBuilder`` has been renamed ``TreeBuilder``, and the
API has undergone several changes.

``ElementTree.getchildren()`` has been deprecated. Use
``list(elem)`` to build a list of the children.

``ElementTree.getiterator()`` has been deprecated. Use ``iter()``
to create an iterator using the normal iterator protocol
instead.

When parsing fails, rather than raising
``xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError``, ``XMLParser`` now raises
``xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError``.

.. _porting-zipimport:

zipimport
---------

.. index::
   pair: porting; zipimport

The data returned from ``get_data()`` is a byte string, and needs to
be decoded before being used as a unicode string.
